### <span style="color:blue">Problem Statement</span>
Given a set of trip-level sensor datasets collected from a person's smart phone, and a set of trip-level sensor datasets collected from an OBDII device in the same person's car, figure out which smart phone trip datasets correspond to which OBDII trip datasets 

### <span style="color:blue">Objective</span>
Write an R script that ingests both lists of trips, and automatically figures out
which OBDII trip corresponds to which phone trip, where "corresponds" means
the two trips captured the same driving. The program need to achieve reasonable accuracy as well as be efficient in running time and easy to read. 

### <span style="color:blue">Deliverable</span>
- A list containing a 2-element list for each match that was found, with the first
element of the list being the subset of the OBDII trip data frame during the
matched interval, and the second element of the list being the subset of the
mobile trip data frame during the matched interval.
- R script submit by a commit history via Github

### <span style="color:blue">Data Source</span>
- obd2Trips.RData, a list containing a data frame of vehicle speed data for
each trip collected from the OBDII plug-in device
- mobileTrips.RData, a list containing a data frame of smart phone speed
data for each trip collected from the phone

Below is preview of the mobile trip data(top) and obd trip data(bottom)


```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggpubr)

load("C:/Users/yijdi/OneDrive/Desktop/trips_data/env.RData")
head(mobileData %>% select(trip_id, timestamp, speed))
head(obdData %>% select(trip_id, timestamp, speed))
```

### <span style="color:blue">Complications</span>

To better visualize the speed variation within a trip to understand the complication, below are line plots between timestamp and speed change from sample trips for both obd and phone.


```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggarrange(
  plot_trip(mobileData, 1, "mobile"), 
  plot_trip(mobileData, 20, "mobile"),
  plot_trip(mobileData, 5, "obd"),
  plot_trip(mobileData, 15, "obd"),
  ncol = 2, nrow = 2
)

```

Following complications are identified:

- Two sources are not one-to-one matching relationship. A trip from one source can have 0 or multiple matched from the other.
- For a matched trip, the start and end index of the common duration from 2 data frames are likely to be different. Not all observations of a matched data set are part of the common duration.
- Inconsistent metrics for both speed and time: This include different measure result for a common duration to different units.
- Noise data exist in various places especially for mobile trip data.

### <span style="color:blue">Methodology</span>

##### 1. Data cleaning
- Covert mobile and obd trip from lists format to 2 large data frames, where the result data frames is vertical bind of each list element.
- Normalize speed unit. Convert mobile speed unit from *m/s* to *km/hr* to match obd2 data based on observation
- Convert timestamp unit to datetime format for mobile set.
- Smooth speed using *loess()* to reduce noise. Although the 'accuracy' column in mobile dataset is somewhat informative of precision, it is not always accurate. The *loess* function smooth data by using local polynomial regression fitting is an effective way to treat noise data.
- Remove bad trip data if its maximum speed is less than 10*km/hr* as it will be heavily driven by noise.

Note that the final output will retain format of raw input. The change of formats is for ease of programming.

##### 2. Split each trip to intervals
The most exhaustive approach to identify common duration is comparing all matching possibilities. Since the common trip can be any segment of a trip for both sources, it is not efficient to iterate through and compare all pairs. Furthermore, this method make result very vulnerable to noise data. 

A more efficient way is to characterize each trip by intervals of speed going ups and downs, and compare the 'similarity' of the intervals. This can be achieved by comparing aggregated speed and time statistics which will be introduced later. Compare aggregated interval instead of each all possible segments is much more efficient in computation time and is more resistant to noise disturbance. 

An interval here is defined as continuous sequence of timestamps with speed > 20*km/hr*. The reason why to choose 20 instead of 0 as cutoff point is there tend to more noise when the vehicle is closer to static. 

##### 3. Calculate interval statistics
An interval will be characterized by following 2 aggregated statistics:

- The length of interval defined as difference between maximum and minimum timestamp
- Speed value at 10^th^, 30^th^, 50^th^, 70^th^, and 90^th^ pecentile

If both statistics are very similar between 2 intervals, they are likely to be a common interval duration although with rare exceptions. However, even on aggregated basis, both statistics are still vulnerable to randomness if there there are few data points in the interval. To maintain relatively credible result, the intervals with maximum speed of less <= 25*km/hr* and time length  <= 40*sec* will be filtered out.

##### 4. Define interval similarity score

Simularity score is calculated using 3 varibles: **speedMatchScore**, **lengthDiff** and **lengthMatchInd** defined as follow:

$$speedMatchScore = 1/5 * \sum_{i}^{10, 30, 50, 70, 90}\left(abs(Speed_{mobileIthPercentile} - Speed_{obdIthPercentile} \right))$$
  

$$lengthDiff = abs(Length_{mobile} - Length_{obd}) / Length_{mobile}$$
$$lengthMatchInd = ifelse(lengthDiff > 0.05, 0, 1)$$

$$intervalMatchScore = e^{ 5 - speedMatchScore - 5 * lengthDiff} * lengthMatchInd$$


The intuition behind definition of the formulas are:

- Due to measurement error, a common interval can be different in speed and time metrics. Using both statistics can correct error caused by one metric if the other one is more accurate.    
- Time difference as opposed to speed is used as baseline standard since final score will be 0 if time absolute difference is larger than 5%. This is because by intuition that interval length is a more "basic metric". Speed percentile characterize the distribution of the speed but can have many variation in shape.  
- When time difference is less than 5%, more weight will be put onto speed difference since it informs the interval more detailed using 5 data points characterizing speed distribution. This unequal contribution rate between time and speed is picked up in the formula that 'speedMatchScore' is in absolute value but 'lengthDiff' is in percentage although the latter is multiplied by 10.
- 5 in *5 - speedMatchScore* is derived using the mind that if average speed difference between two is <5, speed distribution will considered close and contribute positively to final score. e^x^ will be greater than 1 if *x* >0. 
- Finally, the formula is in form of exponent instead of simple summation. This is because due to randomness, different trip can still have intervals similar in 2 statistics. As exponentials have derivative much larger than a linear expression when independent variable is large, the final score is more sensitive to changes in the statistics when the difference is small. Later, trip score will be sum of interval score. Using exponents will make two trips with a pair of very similar intervals more alike than trips with many less similar intervals.

##### 5. Calculate trip matching result between two sources
After step 3, trip A with 2 intervals and B with 4 intervals will get 8 pairs of matching scores. Then I choose 2 intervals with maximum matching score. Of course, they will be completely 2 different pairs that the same interval can not appear in both pairs. The trip match score will be sum of the 2 interval score.

Iterate through both trips train data, and calculate matching score of all pairs which will get 44 * 41 scores. After close comparison between the trip matching scores and speed plots for each trip, I defined benchmark of 25. If the trip match score is over 25, then this pair has a common duration and vice versa. 


Below is distribution of final scores selected score indication matched trips between phone and odb. The score ranges from  25 to 317
```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(
  tripScorePlotDf,
  aes(reorder(name, -score)) 
) + geom_col(aes(y = score), fill = 'orange' ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  labs(
    title = "distribution of final trip matching score: mobile vs obd "
  )

```


##### 6.Calculate common trip timeframe for each matched trip
For all matched trip pairs, first select the interval with largest interval matching score. Compare the gap between interval start time and trip start time between mobile trip and obd2 trip. Interval start time subtract minimum of the two will be the starting timestamp of common segment. Use same logic to derive end timestamp of common duration.

Filter the data by begin and end time of common duration for the trips that had match. Convert two subsets to list of data frames like raw import.

### <span style="color:blue">Analysis of result</span>
We can better visualize the matched trips in single plots using common timestamp. Below are some examples.

Below is the pair mobile_26 vs obd_34 which returned best matching result. There are some disagreements
in the tails

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
combinedTripPlot(commonTripTimeframe, mobileData, obdData, 26)
```

Below is the pair ranked number 5 best.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
combinedTripPlot(commonTripTimeframe, mobileData, obdData, 1)
```

Here is a pair with lower score rank. The low rank seems to be caused by inconsistency in time length for the largest interval in the middle. The mobile phone may fail to capture some motion in this case. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
combinedTripPlot(commonTripTimeframe, mobileData, obdData, 25)
```

Another example with low matching score but passed 25 benchmark. In this case, the signal from
phone is much noisier. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
combinedTripPlot(commonTripTimeframe, mobileData, obdData, 24)
```

##### Take aways   
- the matching algorithms can well identify the same trip between obd and phone
- signals from phone is overall noisier than that from obd
- phone detects and records motion overall later than obd



### <span style="color:blue">Potential improvement</span>
One drawback of this algorithm is validation and parameter tuning are done by eyeballing predictions. There are too many parameters, and it is likely that they can be further optimized. 

With more training data, this can be programmed into a neural network. Instead of maximizing similarity score, the algorithm can be iteratively run to minimize a cost function such as 5 - speedSimilarity - 5*timeSimilarity. Hyperparameters can thus be more optimized.
